# üö® Stacks AI Payment Agents - Current Status

## **Issue Identified: Demo Mode Only**

Your question about testnet explorer functionality revealed a critical issue - the system is currently running in **demo mode only** and not creating real blockchain transactions.

### **What's Actually Happening:**
- ‚ùå **Fake Transaction IDs**: Random hex strings, not real blockchain TXs
- ‚ùå **No Smart Contracts Deployed**: Contracts exist in code but aren't deployed to testnet
- ‚ùå **Explorer Links Broken**: Point to non-existent transactions
- ‚ùå **Demo Mode Fallback**: All operations simulate blockchain calls

### **Evidence from Backend Logs:**
```
Blockchain registration failed, using demo mode: Improperly formatted private-key
```

## **Root Causes:**

1. **Smart Contracts Not Deployed**: The deployment script requires `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
2. **Missing Testnet Funding**: Deployer address needs STX tokens for contract deployment
3. **Demo Mode Fallback**: System falls back to fake transactions when blockchain calls fail

## **To Enable Real Blockchain Transactions:**

### **Step 1: Generate Keys & Fund Addresses**
```bash
# Generate new deployment keys
node scripts/setup-real-deployment.js

# Fund the generated addresses at:
# https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Smart Contracts**
```bash
# Deploy to testnet (requires funded addresses)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-key> node scripts/deploy-contracts.js
```

### **Step 3: Update Backend Configuration**
```bash
# Update backend/.env with deployed contract addresses
# Restart backend to use real blockchain
```

## **Current System Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Fully functional with chatbot, contacts, explorer links
- ‚úÖ **Backend API**: Working with demo mode fallback
- ‚ùå **Smart Contracts**: Not deployed to testnet
- ‚ùå **Real Transactions**: Not creating actual blockchain TXs

## **Next Steps:**
The system architecture is complete and ready for real blockchain deployment. The deployment process requires:
1. Testnet STX tokens for gas fees
2. Contract deployment to testnet
3. Backend configuration update

Once deployed, all explorer links will show real transactions on the Stacks testnet explorer.
